avoiding-raindrops
==================

ASP .NET MVC 5 Application, SQL Server 2012, Bootstrap and Jquery hosted as a Web Site on Windows Azure 
@ http://avoiding-raindrops.azurewebsites.net/
 
This application was the object of 3 days exam at the end of one year intensive training in OO Progamming on different technologies.
It is supposed to simulate several countries meteorological stations that pick up data every 30 minutes and record it directly into the application. The website allows visitors to perfom very basic statistics (like min, max and average Temp) and provides a Web service when Ajax requests come in for several type of data research. It then delivers Json data from a SQL DB.
